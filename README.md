# Hi there, I'm Tushar ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Mumbai-based software developer fueled by equal parts caffeine and curiosity. When I'm not delving into the depths of programming and design, you'll probably find me watching documentaries.

Oh, and fun fact: I've been known to keep one eye on AI advancements, just in case our future robot overlords start learning JavaScript... and I'm scared they might judge my coding style.  

Let's create some awe-inspiring software together, before the machines rise!"

## ðŸ”­ Current Work

I'm currently working on a project for automated interviews using LLMs.

## ðŸŒ± Skills

I'm proficient in Flutter, NodeJs, JavaScript, including Express and React. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in my field.
